## Processing Workflow (per document)

1. `python gmp_engine.py scaffold ISPE-XXX --source ISPE` ← already done for all 15
2. Edit `reports.json` — fill in title, tags, colors (green family), section_map
3. Extract PDF text → `ISPE/ISPE-XXX/source/` (use pdftotext or PyMuPDF)
4. Generate bilingual HTML sections using PROMPT.md template
5. `python gmp_engine.py merge ISPE-XXX`
6. Update `knowledge/INDEX.md` — add block with `ISPE/ISPE-XXX-Complete.md` header
7. Move source PDF to `Raw pdfs/processed/` (optional — keep in source/ for reference)
8. Verify in browser → commit + push

```bash
git add ISPE/ISPE-XXX/ reports.json knowledge/ && git commit -m "Add ISPE-XXX: [title]"
```

## Notes

- **ISPE-Vol5** has two PDFs: English original (`ISPE volume 5 Commissioning & Qualification 2nd Edition().pdf`) and a Chinese translation (`ISPE Baseline Guide vol5 2nd edition C and Q translated by 426.pdf`). Use Chinese translation as a reference aid for generating Chinese commentary — do not use it as primary source.
- **ISPE-Vol3** has two PDFs: the main Baseline Vol.3 and a 2011 version (`ISPE Sterile product manufacturing facilities_2011.pdf`). Use the main version; 2011 version is for historical reference.
- **ISPE-GAMP5**: 2nd edition (2022) obtained and in progress.
