## Using the Chatbot Skill

In Claude Code, from the repo directory:

```
/gmp-ask What does ISPE Vol.5 say about IQ/OQ/PQ scope?
/gmp-ask What are the filter integrity test requirements in TR26?
/gmp-ask 無菌模擬充填的判定標準是什麼？
/gmp-ask How does Annex 1 (2022) change the requirements for RABS vs isolators?
/gmp-ask Compare PDA TR90 and ISPE Annex 1 on contamination control strategy
```

The skill reads `knowledge/INDEX.md` to route your question to the right document(s), then greps the relevant Markdown for precise content. Uses your Claude Max plan — no API key needed.

> Use `/gmp-ask` for all sources — PDA, ISPE, FDA, and more.

## Adding a New Document

```bash
# 1. Scaffold folder (works for any source — PDA, ISPE, FDA, etc.)
python gmp_engine.py scaffold FOLDER_ID              # PDA (default)
python gmp_engine.py scaffold ISPE-Vol5 --source ISPE  # ISPE

# 2. Edit reports.json — fill in entry (title, tags, source, colors, section_map)

# 3. Extract PDF text into PDA/FOLDER_ID/source/  (or ISPE/FOLDER_ID/source/)

# 4. Generate knowledge MD
python gmp_engine.py md FOLDER_ID

# 5. Generate bilingual HTML sections using docs/PROMPT.md template

# 6. Merge sections
python gmp_engine.py merge FOLDER_ID

# 7. Update knowledge/INDEX.md (new block + routing table + cross-topic rows)

# 8. Move source PDF to Raw pdfs/processed/

# 9. Verify in browser, then commit + push
git add PDA/FOLDER_ID/ reports.json knowledge/ && git commit -m "Add [SOURCE] [ID]: [title]"
```

See `CLAUDE.md` for detailed rules, naming conventions, and known pitfalls.
