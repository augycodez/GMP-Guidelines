# /project-sync

You are a project consistency auditor for the GMP-Guidelines repository. Run all steps below in order. For each step, report PASS or list specific issues found. After reporting, fix any issues you found directly — do not ask for confirmation on straightforward updates.

---

## Step 1 — Parse ground truth from reports.json

Run this and capture the output:

```bash
python3 -c "
import json, collections
d = json.load(open('reports.json'))
src = collections.Counter()
total = 0
for k, v in d['reports'].items():
    if v.get('section_map'):
        parts = v.get('source','').split()
        s = parts[0] if parts else k
        src[s] += 1
        total += 1
print('=== Complete documents by source ===')
for k, v in sorted(src.items()): print(f'  {k}: {v}')
print(f'  TOTAL: {total}')
"
```

This is the authoritative count. All other files must agree with it.

---

## Step 2 — ROADMAP.md sync

Read `docs/ROADMAP.md` and check:

1. **"Last updated" line** — does the date match today (or the most recent push date)?
2. **"Current Status at a Glance" table** — do the counts match Step 1 output?
3. **Per-source rows in Layer 1 Completion Summary** — do they match Step 1?
4. **Active Priorities** — are they still the right next actions, or has something been completed?
5. **Phase task tables** — any tasks completed since last update that haven't been ticked off?

If any mismatch → edit `docs/ROADMAP.md` to correct it. Only change what's wrong; do not rewrite stable sections.

---

## Step 3 — knowledge/INDEX.md sync

Run this to list all knowledge MDs:

```bash
find knowledge/ -name "*.md" ! -name "INDEX.md" ! -name "INDEX-router.md" ! -name "INDEX-verbose.md" | sort
```

For each file found, verify it has a routing entry in `knowledge/INDEX.md`. Look for the filename in the Quick Topic Routing Guide table and in the document blocks.

Report any knowledge MDs missing from INDEX.md. If found, add the missing entries.

---

## Step 4 — Folder structure integrity

Run this to list all document folders:

```bash
for dir in PDA ISPE FDA ICH USP ISO PICS; do
  [ -d "$dir" ] && find "$dir" -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d | sort
done
```

Then cross-check: every folder listed should have a matching entry in `reports.json` with a `folder` field pointing to it. 

Also check: every `reports.json` entry with a `folder` field should have a corresponding directory on disk.

Report any orphaned folders (on disk but not in reports.json) or ghost entries (in reports.json but no folder on disk).

---

## Step 5 — CLAUDE.md freshness

Read `CLAUDE.md` and check:

1. **Naming Conventions section** — does it cover all source orgs currently in use? Check against the source orgs in Step 1.
2. **File Structure Convention diagram** — does it reflect the current actual folder structure?
3. **Known Pitfalls** — are there any new pitfalls from recent sessions that should be documented?

Report any gaps. Only update CLAUDE.md if there is a clear, specific addition needed.

---

## Step 6 — Expert Knowledge Base status

Check `knowledge/EXPERT/` directory:

```bash
ls knowledge/EXPERT/ 2>/dev/null || echo "Directory does not exist yet"
```

Compare files found against the 9-file plan in `docs/ROADMAP.md` Expert Knowledge Base Status table. Update the Status column (⬜ / 🔄 / ✅) for any files that now exist or are in progress.

---

## Output format

After all steps, output a summary:

```
=== /project-sync results ===

Step 1 — Ground truth:    [total] docs complete ([breakdown by source])
Step 2 — ROADMAP.md:      PASS / [N issues fixed]
Step 3 — INDEX.md:        PASS / [N missing entries added]
Step 4 — Folder integrity: PASS / [N issues found]
Step 5 — CLAUDE.md:       PASS / [N additions made]
Step 6 — Expert KB:       [N/9 files exist]

Files changed: [list any files actually edited]
```

If all steps pass with no changes needed, output: `All project files in sync. No changes needed.`
