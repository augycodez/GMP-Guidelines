# GMP-Guidelines — Skills Roadmap

Planned Claude Code skills (slash commands) for the GMP-Guidelines repository. Each skill is designed to apply the knowledge base in the `knowledge/` folder to produce structured, actionable outputs.

**Status:** Brainstorm / Planning — not yet built  
**Existing:** `/gmp-ask` (see `.claude/commands/gmp-ask.md`)  
**Last updated:** 2026-04-01

**Department codes:** QA= | QC= | MG= | EN= | TS= | WH= | RA= | BD= | BT=

**Column notes:**
- **Initiating Dept** — who typically starts the workflow (discovers the event, submits the request, writes the first draft)
- **QA role** — how QA participates (Lead = owns and drives; Review = approves/oversees; Support = provides input)

## Skill Design Principles

Each skill is designed to:
1. **Read the knowledge base** — pull from relevant `knowledge/` markdown files, not general LLM knowledge
2. **Produce structured output** — not a chat answer, but a usable document section or checklist
3. **Cite sources** — every key requirement references a specific document and section
4. **Be CDMO-specific** — examples and context tailored to aseptic fill-finish CDMO operations
5. **Be bilingual** — outputs in Traditional Chinese with English technical terms preserved

## Build Priority

| Priority | Skills | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **P0** | `/deviation`, `/change-control` | Highest daily frequency, immediate operational value |
| **P1** | `/em-excursion`, `/sop-new`, `/sop-revision`, `/annex1-check`, `/inspection-prep`, `/client-audit`, `/oos-investigate`, `/cc-sop-impact` | Core quality system activities |
| **P2** | `/complaint`, `/reg-gap`, `/di-check`, `/pqr-framework`, `/feasibility`, `/hbel-screen`, `/bd-qa`, `/batch-release`, `/training-content`, `/csv-plan` | Periodic or scenario-specific |
| **P3** | `/cpv-review`, `/tech-transfer`, `/qualification-plan`, `/validation-xref`, `/risk-assess`, `/supplier-qual` | Project-level or complex design |

## File Location

When built, all skills go in:
```
.claude/skills/<skill-name>.md
```

Per CLAUDE.md project rules: custom skills must be stored in `.claude/skills/` relative to project root.
