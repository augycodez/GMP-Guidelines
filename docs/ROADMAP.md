# GMP-Guidelines — Comprehensive Scope & Roadmap

This document summarizes the current coverage status, gap analysis, and expansion roadmap for building a comprehensive sterile pharmaceutical manufacturing knowledge hub suitable for COO-level operational decision-making.

Last updated: 2026-05-06 — added topic synthesis `knowledge/topics/intrinsic-sterile-connection-vs-aseptic-connection.md` (cross-document distinction between aseptic connection and ISCD: PIC/S Annex 1 2022 §8.14/§8.15/§8.128–§8.130/§8.137 + Glossary, PDA Guide No.1 Glossary, PDA PtC-14 §3, ICH Q9(R1) §6.4); INDEX.md (Quick Topic Routing Guide row + Cross-Report Topics entry) and INDEX-router.md (Synonym Table row + Aseptic & Sterile Processing row) updated. Previously (2026-04-27): 183 documents complete (PDA 43, USP 76, ISPE 14, FDA 15, ICH 6, PIC/S 5, ISO 17, Ph.Eur. 7); added PDA TR74 (Revised 2026) "Reprocessing and Reworking of Biologicals" — 7 sections, 9 HTML files (sec5/sec6 A/B split), 41 figures+tables extracted; generated via parallel agent dispatch. Earlier on 2026-04-27: extract-figs clipping fixes — figure caption strip extends up to image bottom (axis labels no longer cut), table clip extends downward through note/source/footnote lines (capped 140pt). Re-extracted full corpus: 1688 figures + 1505 tables = 3193 entries (was 2632). Previously (2026-04-22): Figures & Tables Gallery revamp complete — full-corpus gap-fill audit across 132 docs recovered 73 figures (2559 → 2632 entries, 96% recovery); 4 residual not-founds accepted as precision/recall trade-offs. Renovated root folder structure (utility scripts → `scripts/`, legacy `index-v2.html` → `archive/`); TR73 expanded from Sections 12–18 partial to full 18-section complete version (+11 bilingual sections, p1–p102); added topic synthesis `knowledge/topics/depyrogenation-tunnel-validation.md`.

## System Architecture

The hub is designed as a layered knowledge system. Skills (slash commands) read from all layers to produce site-grounded, regulation-backed outputs.

```
Education Layer: Document Discovery & Learning   index.html / learning-path.html / mindmap.html
  Bilingual dashboard, department curriculum,    ← This repo (public)  ✅ COMPLETE
  interactive mind map — powered by reports.json
  + gmp-curriculum-data.js

Layer 1: Regulatory / Technical Reference    knowledge/
  PDA, ISPE, PIC/S, FDA, ICH, USP, ISO      ← This repo (public)  ✅ COMPLETE

Expert Knowledge Base                        knowledge/EXPERT/
  Practitioner insights, case experience,   ← This repo (public)  ⬜ IN PROGRESS
  real-world implementation notes
  (bridges Layer 1 theory → Layer 2 practice)

Layer 2: Operational Frameworks              .claude/skills/_shared/
  Templates, decision frameworks,            ← This repo (public)  ⬜ TO BUILD
  checklists, reference tables

Layer 3: Site-Specific Documents             ~/Amaran-Site-Knowledge/
  Desensitized SOPs, WIs,                   ← Separate private repo ⬜ IN PROGRESS
  IQ/OQ/PQ reports, validation reports
```

**Design Principle — Knowledge Cycle, Not Just Stack:**
This architecture is not a one-way pipeline from reference → practice. It operates as a DIKW cycle (Data → Information → Knowledge → Application → feedback), aligned with PDA TR60 §6.5.1's model and ICH Q10 §1.6.1's KM definition. Concretely:
- **Layer 1** (regulatory MDs) supplies *information*; **Expert KB** adds *knowledge* (interpretation, judgment, failure modes)
- **Layer 2 skills** both **consume** knowledge (reading from Layer 1 + Expert KB) and **produce** knowledge (skill outputs feed back into Expert KB and Layer 3 as operational records)
- **Education Layer** serves as the KM delivery mechanism — converting specialized knowledge into forms usable by non-specialist personnel (TR60 §6.5.3: "KM cannot be in a form usable only by specialized personnel")
- System design follows **FAIR principles** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) per TR60 §6.5.2: reports.json as single index (F), knowledge MDs in plain Markdown (A/I), skills as reusable frameworks (R)
- **CDMO knowledge isolation**: client product knowledge stays in Layer 3 (private repo); platform/process knowledge is shared across layers (public repo). This mirrors TR60 Ch7's PTT model adapted for multi-client CDMO context.

**Why separate repos for Layer 3:** This repo is public. Site SOPs contain proprietary process logic and may reflect client product information. Even after desensitization, the document structure itself carries IP risk. Layer 3 lives in a private repo, read locally by skills.

## Education Layer — Document Discovery & Learning Tools ✅ COMPLETE

Three browser-based tools provide document discovery, role-based learning, and knowledge visualization. All data is driven by `reports.json` and `gmp-curriculum-data.js` — no hardcoded content.

### index.html — Document Index Dashboard

Bilingual (EN/ZH-TW) searchable document index with deep search across titles, summaries, and section content.

- Source-based filtering (PDA, ISPE, FDA, ICH, PIC/S, USP, ISO, Ph.Eur.)
- Tag-based filtering with color-coded topic pills
- Reading history with localStorage persistence
- Relevance scoring with per-field match badges
- Sort by relevance, date, or source
- Links to: `learning-path.html`, `mindmap.html`, `quiz.html`

### learning-path.html — Department Curriculum Tracker

Role-based reading tracker powered by `gmp-curriculum-data.js`. Covers 8 departments × 3 tiers.

| Department | Icon | Tier 1 Foundation | Tier 2 Core | Tier 3 Advanced |
|-----------|------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Quality Assurance | 🛡️ | 5 docs | 8 docs | 4 docs |
| Quality Control | 🔬 | 7 docs | 16 docs | 12 docs |
| Manufacturing / Production | ⚙️ | 5 docs | 7 docs | 6 docs |
| Engineering & Maintenance | 🔧 | 5 docs | 6 docs | 5 docs |
| Regulatory Affairs | 📋 | 5 docs | 6 docs | 5 docs |
| Warehouse | 🏗️ | 6 docs | 6 docs | 4 docs |
| Technical Service | 🛠️ | 5 docs | 7 docs | 5 docs |
| Biotechnology IT (BT) | 💻 | 5 docs | 6 docs | 5 docs |

Features: checkbox progress tracking, Required/Optional badges, per-department progress rings, overall completion percentage — all persisted in localStorage. Quiz score badges (🎯 95%) appear on each doc row when a quiz has been attempted.

### quiz.html — Quiz Score Tracker

Browser-based quiz history dashboard. Stores exam results in localStorage (`gmp-quiz-results`). Receives results via paste-JSON workflow from Claude Code `/quiz` skill.

| Tab | Function |
|-----|----------|
| Quiz History | All attempts grouped by doc_key, with per-question breakdown and color-coded score pills |
| Record Result | Paste JSON output from Claude → validate → save to localStorage |
| How to Use | Step-by-step instructions |

Score tiers: ≥80% = green, 60–79% = yellow, <60% = red.

### /quiz Skill — Interactive Exam Conductor

Claude Code slash command (`.claude/commands/quiz.md`). Accepts a doc key or topic path:

```
/quiz TR22
/quiz topics/APS-filling-isolator
/quiz PICS-Annex15
```

Workflow: resolve doc → read knowledge MD (or exam bank JSON from `knowledge/exams/`) → silently design 10 questions → ask one at a time → score each answer immediately → output final JSON block for pasting into `quiz.html`.

Question bank directory: `knowledge/exams/` — pre-written questions in JSON format for repeatability. First bank: `topics-APS-filling-isolator.json` (10 questions, derived from live exam 2026-04-10, score 95/100).

### mindmap.html — Knowledge Mind Map

Interactive D3.js + Markmap-powered visualization of the entire knowledge base. Three view modes:

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| By Department | Shows 8 department tracks with Foundation → Core → Advanced hierarchy |
| By Topic | Groups documents into 10 thematic clusters (Aseptic Processing, Sterilization & Filtration, Container Closure, Quality Systems, Environmental Monitoring, Testing Methods, Facilities & Utilities, Advanced Therapies, Regulatory & Compliance, Emerging Technologies) |
| By Source | Organizes all 182 documents by issuing organization (PDA, ISPE, FDA, ICH, PIC/S, USP, ISO, Ph.Eur.) |

### gmp-curriculum-data.js — Curriculum Data File

Single source of truth for learning path structure. Consumed by `learning-path.html` and `mindmap.html`.

- `departments[]` — 8 department objects (QA, QC, Production, Engineering, RA, Warehouse, Technical Service, BT/IT), each with `tiers[]` containing curated `docs[]` (key + required flag + rationale)
- `topicClusters[]` — 10 topic clusters with tag-based matching for mind-map "By Topic" view
- `sourceOrgs{}` — 8 source organization labels and brand colors
- Helper functions: `generateDeptMarkdown()`, `generateTopicMarkdown()`, `generateSourceMarkdown()` (used by Markmap renderer)

## Expert Knowledge Base — Practitioner Layer

> **Session note — 2026-04-07:** This layer was planned to capture David Kuo's 10 years of sterile manufacturing experience as a structured knowledge layer. It sits alongside Layer 1 (regulatory reference) as interpretive, experiential content — the "what it actually means in practice" companion to official guidelines.

### What This Layer Is

Layer 1 documents what regulations *say*. This layer documents what a practitioner *knows from doing it* — the failure modes, judgment calls, shortcuts that backfire, and decisions that aren't documented anywhere. In TR60's Venn diagram model, Layer 1 is **Explicit Knowledge** (regulatory guidance, published research); this layer captures **Tacit Knowledge** (industry experience, SME insights, innovation patterns) — and the critical overlap between them. Knowledge of this type is:
- Tacit (in someone's head, not in any guideline)
- Rare (very few people have the same cross-functional exposure)
- Perishable (gets lost when people move on or organizations change)
- High-leverage (saves weeks of trial and error for the next person)

**Capture Waves — Progressive Knowledge Extraction:**
- **Wave 1** (current scope): David's 9 ownable knowledge files — one-time extraction from a single practitioner's career experience. This is the **tacit → explicit conversion** that TR60 §6.5.3 identifies as the hardest but most valuable KM activity.
- **Wave 2** (organic growth): Operational decision patterns captured through Layer 2 skill usage. As skills run against real deviations, tech transfers, and batch releases, the decision rationale and outcomes accumulate as structured knowledge — analogous to TR60 Ch7's "Specification File maintained and updated throughout product lifetime."
- **Wave 3** (future): Other key personnel's domain expertise (QA, QC, engineering leads). Extends the same capture methods to build organizational rather than individual knowledge.

**CDMO-Specific Design Choices** (derived from TR60 §6.5.3 and Ch7):
- **Stage 1→2 handoff risk**: TR60 identifies this transition as the primary knowledge-loss point ("different equipment, different batch sizes, different personnel responsibilities"). For a CDMO, this happens with *every new client tech transfer* — making robust KM existential, not optional.
- **Living document principle**: Expert KB files are not write-once memoirs. Following TR60 Ch7's Product Technical Team model, they are updated when new evidence emerges (new deviation patterns, new client TT learnings, equipment lifecycle events).
- **Platform knowledge isolation**: Expert KB captures *platform knowledge* (how our SA25 behaves, how our facility operates) separate from client product knowledge (which stays in Layer 3). This enables cross-client learning without confidentiality breach.

### Practitioner Background — David Kuo

| Period | Role | Organization | Key Domain |
|--------|------|-------------|------------|
| 2014–2016 | Assistant Scientist | TWi Pharmaceuticals | Parenteral lyo ANDA formulation development |
| 2016–2018 | Manager | Noratech Pharmaceuticals | US ANDA tech transfer, CMO/CRO management, CTD filing → FDA approval |
| 2018–2019 | Production Specialist | Pfizer | Aseptic processing (antibiotic injectables), deviation handling |
| 2019–2021 | Senior Technology Development Specialist | Amaran Biotech | DP line expansion (conceptual → construction → C&Q), DS scale-up tech transfer |
| 2021–2025 | Assistant Manufacturing Manager | Amaran Biotech | Vanrx SA25 robotic filling (full lifecycle), VPHP validation, APS, new format integration |
| 2025–now | Plant Operations Director | Amaran Biotech | 4-dept CDMO operations, 6 customer tech transfers, AI integration into GMP ops |

**Proof points:**
- ANDA 211463 — US FDA approved 2019-09-13 (parenteral lyo + diluent, first end-to-end ANDA managed as PM)
- Vanrx SA25 — virtual installation through annual requalification, VPHP cycle dev & validation, new format integration
- DP line built from zero — HAZOP, value engineering, construction supervision, C&Q completion
- 6 customer products — 100% on-spec commercial batches delivered on schedule as CDMO

### Ownable Knowledge Areas (Priority-Ranked)

| Priority | Topic | Why It's Ownable | Target File |
|----------|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| **#1** | Vanrx SA25 robotic aseptic filling — full lifecycle | Few SA25 sites globally; no public case documentation | `knowledge/EXPERT/vanrx-SA25-lifecycle.md` |
| **#2** | Lyo ANDA end-to-end: bench → FDA approval | Entire arc owned, ANDA 211463 as evidence | `knowledge/EXPERT/lyo-ANDA-end-to-end.md` |
| **#3** | AI in GMP operations — live implementation | Already running in GMP environment 2025 | `knowledge/EXPERT/ai-in-gmp-operations.md` |
| **#4** | CDMO DP line: zero to commercial | "Build and run" perspective | `knowledge/EXPERT/cdmo-line-build-to-commercial.md` |
| **#5** | Sponsor ↔ CMO dual perspective | Rare bilateral view of tech transfer dynamics | `knowledge/EXPERT/sponsor-cmo-bilateral-view.md` |
| **#6** | VPHP cycle development & validation | Minimal public documentation on decision process | `knowledge/EXPERT/vphp-cycle-development.md` |
| **#7** | Aseptic filling deviation patterns | 23 deviation reports + ongoing CDMO handling | `knowledge/EXPERT/aseptic-deviation-patterns.md` |
| **#8** | US ANDA CTD authorship (parenteral) | Practical authorship decisions, FDA review dynamics | `knowledge/EXPERT/anda-ctd-authorship.md` |
| **#9** | CDMO business operations | Cost reduction (15–20% savings), BD, client audit prep | `knowledge/EXPERT/cdmo-operations-economics.md` |

### Capture Method

| Input Type | Method |
|-----------|--------|
| Existing Word/PDF documents | Extract + restructure into knowledge MD format |
| Partial notes + recall | Structured interview (topic-by-topic guided Q&A) |
| Pure recall | Guided oral dictation with follow-up questions |

**Format:** Each knowledge MD uses the same conventions as `knowledge/PDA/*.md` — but content is original practitioner knowledge. Source attribution: `Source: David Kuo, direct experience [year range]`.

### Status

| File | Status | Input Available |
|------|--------|----------------|
| `vanrx-SA25-lifecycle.md` | ⬜ Not started | Recall + possible internal docs |
| `lyo-ANDA-end-to-end.md` | ⬜ Not started | Recall (ANDA 211463 as anchor) |
| `ai-in-gmp-operations.md` | ⬜ Not started | Recall + AI tool artifacts |
| `cdmo-line-build-to-commercial.md` | ⬜ Not started | Recall + possible C&Q docs |
| `sponsor-cmo-bilateral-view.md` | ⬜ Not started | Recall |

| `aseptic-deviation-patterns.md` | ⬜ Not started | Recall |
| `anda-ctd-authorship.md` | ⬜ Not started | Recall |
| `cdmo-operations-economics.md` | ⬜ Not started | Recall |

### Knowledge Refresh Mechanism

Expert KB files are living documents. Updates are triggered by **CDMO operational events**, not by calendar schedule — following TR60 Ch7's principle that "manufacturing-knowledge documentation files are updated regularly with all pertinent studies."

| Trigger Event | Which Files to Review | What to Add |
|--------------|----------------------|-------------|
| New client tech transfer completed | `sponsor-cmo-bilateral-view.md`, `cdmo-operations-economics.md` | TT friction points, knowledge gaps encountered, onboarding lessons |
| Annual APS campaign | `vanrx-SA25-lifecycle.md`, `aseptic-deviation-patterns.md` | Intervention patterns, media fill outcomes, equipment behavior drift |
| Critical/Major deviation closed | `aseptic-deviation-patterns.md`, relevant topic file | Root cause pattern, investigation approach, corrective action effectiveness |
| New product format integrated | `vanrx-SA25-lifecycle.md`, `cdmo-line-build-to-commercial.md` | Equipment configuration decisions, C&Q scope differences, format-specific risks |
| Client or regulatory audit completed | `cdmo-operations-economics.md`, `ai-in-gmp-operations.md` | Observations received, audit preparation insights, documentation gaps identified |
| Layer 2 skill used on real case | Relevant Expert KB file | Decision rationale and outcome — Wave 2 organic knowledge capture |

> This mechanism closes the DIKW feedback loop: operational **data** (deviation records, batch data, audit findings) is processed through Layer 2 skills into **information**, interpreted against Layer 1 references into **knowledge**, and fed back into Expert KB as **application** insights for future use.

## Layer 2: Operational Frameworks

### Operational MD Files to Build (~27 files)

| Type | Files | Used by |
|------|-------|---------|
| Output templates | deviation report, CAPA, OOS worksheet, CC form, SOP structure, PQR chapter, FMEA, IQ/OQ/PQ scope, tech transfer checklist, supplier audit | All major skills |
| Decision frameworks | deviation classification, change classification, batch disposition, HBEL/MACO calc, GAMP category, supplier type matrix | deviation, change-control, batch-release, hbel-screen, csv-plan |
| Checklists | EM excursion response, inspection filling area, inspection QC lab, inspection warehouse, client audit data room, tech transfer 6-stage | em-excursion, inspection-prep, client-audit, tech-transfer |
| Reference tables | Annex 1 section map, FDA 483 common observations, validation trigger matrix, DI 9-Box framework, CPV statistical guide | annex1-check, inspection-prep, validation-xref, di-check, cpv-review |

### Skills System — 26 Slash Commands

See `SKILLS.md` for the full skill list with usage scenarios, initiating departments, and QA roles.

**Build priority:**

| Priority | Skills | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| P0 | `/deviation`, `/change-control` | Highest daily frequency |
| P1 | `/em-excursion`, `/sop-new`, `/sop-revision`, `/annex1-check`, `/inspection-prep`, `/client-audit`, `/oos-investigate`, `/cc-sop-impact` | Core quality system activities |
| P2 | `/complaint`, `/reg-gap`, `/di-check`, `/pqr-framework`, `/feasibility`, `/hbel-screen`, `/bd-qa`, `/batch-release`, `/training-content`, `/csv-plan` | Periodic or scenario-specific |
| P3 | `/cpv-review`, `/tech-transfer`, `/qualification-plan`, `/validation-xref`, `/risk-assess`, `/supplier-qual` | Project-level or complex |

**Skills with supporting files use a folder structure:**

```
.claude/skills/
├── _shared/               ← cross-skill templates and frameworks
├── deviation/
│   ├── deviation.md       ← skill prompt (the slash command)
│   ├── template-deviation-report.md
│   └── template-capa.md
├── change-control/
│   ├── change-control.md
│   ├── template-cc-form.md
│   └── framework-change-classification.md
└── gmp-ask.md             ← simple skills: single file, no folder
```

**Bottlenecks:**
- Skills iteration — first version always needs 2–3 real-case test cycles before stable

---

## Layer 3: Site-Specific Documents

Layer 3 is fed by the Amaran AI SOP project (`~/Amaran-AI-SOP/`), which already has:
- `sop_to_markdown.py` — SOP → Markdown conversion (v3.7)
- `amaran_redact.py` — desensitization script
- 9 pilot SOPs converted and verified

**Human review is required for every desensitized document before it enters Layer 3.** This step cannot be automated (~20 min/SOP).

## Expansion Roadmap

### Phases 1–3: COMPLETE (archived 2026-04)

All PDA TRs (42), top ISPE guides (14), PIC/S documents (5, incl. PE 011 Guide), FDA guidances + CFR chapters (15), ICH Q8–Q14 (6), USP 76 chapters, ISO 17 standards, and Ph.Eur. 7 chapters are fully processed (bilingual HTML + knowledge MD). Infrastructure (dashboard, tooling, workflow) is complete and stable.

### Phase 4: Active — Topic Gap-Fillers

**Goal:** Fill remaining Layer 1 content gaps. Requires sourcing new PDFs.

| Task | Document | Effort | Status |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| ISO addition | ISO 14644-2 (monitoring), ISO 14644-3 (test methods) | Medium | ⬜ Need PDF |
| PDA addition | TR36 — Lyophilization | Medium | ⬜ Need PDF |
| ISO addition | ISO 17665 — Steam sterilization | Medium | ⬜ Need PDF |
| ISPE completion | GEP — Good Engineering Practice | Medium | ❌ Blocked (OCR) |
| ~~FDA additions~~ | ~~Container Closure Guidance, Terminal Sterilization Guidance~~ | Medium | ✅ Done (4 docs: CCIT, ContainerClosure, GlassVial, ParametricRelease) |

### Phase 5: Active — Combination Products Device Layer + Additional Standards

**Goal:** Add device-side standards for PFS, autoinjector, pen injector clients. Add remaining high-value PDA reports.

| Task | Document | Effort | Status |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| ISO addition | ISO 14971 — Risk Management for Medical Devices | Medium | ❌ Blocked (scanned PDF) |
| ISO addition | ISO 11608-3 — Finished containers | Small | ⬜ Need PDF |
| IEC addition | IEC 62366-1 — Usability Engineering / Human Factors | Medium | ⬜ Need PDF |
| FDA addition | Design Considerations for Combination Products (2019 Draft) | Small | ⬜ Need PDF |

| PDA addition | TR69 (2014) — Bioburden & Biofilm in Pharma Water Systems | Medium | ⬜ Need PDF |

### Phase 4b: Active — Warehouse Practice Expansion

**Goal:** Strengthen warehouse operations coverage — GDP framework, storage condition management, material receipt. Current warehouse curriculum (27 docs) covers packaging, CCI, and cold chain well, but lacks comprehensive GDP standards and storage qualification upstream documents.

| Task | Document | Effort | Status |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| PIC/S addition | **PIC/S PE 011 — GDP Guide** | Medium | ✅ Done (2026-04-14) |
| WHO addition | **WHO TRS 961 Annex 6 — GDP for Pharmaceutical Products** | Small | ⬜ Need PDF (moved from Phase 6) |
| ICH addition | **ICH Q1A(R2) — Stability Testing** (defines storage condition requirements) | Medium | ⬜ Need PDF |

**Priority order:** PE 011 → TRS 961 Annex 6 → ICH Q1A(R2)

**Warehouse structural deliverables** (no new PDFs required):

| Task | Output | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| Topic synthesis | `knowledge/topics/warehouse-storage-GDP.md` — cross-document synthesis of existing 27 warehouse docs | ⬜ To build |
| Exam bank | `knowledge/exams/topics-warehouse.json` — warehouse question bank | ⬜ To build |

### Phase 6: Future — EU + Global Market Expansion

**Trigger:** Add when EU-client volume justifies the effort, or when an EU inspection is scheduled.

| Task | Document | Effort | Status |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| EU GMP | Annex 15 — Qualification and Validation (2015) | Small | ⬜ Future |
| EU GMP | Annex 2 — Biological Medicinal Products (2012) | Small | ⬜ Future |
| EU GMP | Annex 20 — Quality Risk Management | Small | ⬜ Future |
| ~~WHO~~ | ~~TRS 961 Annex 6 — Sterile Products~~ | ~~Small~~ | ✅ Moved to Phase 4b (Warehouse) |
| WHO | TRS 1010 — Biological Products | Small | ⬜ Future |
| ISO | ISO 11737-1 — Sterilization: Bioburden Determination | Small | ⬜ Need PDF |
| ISO | ISO 11737-2 — Sterilization: Sterility Testing | Small | ⬜ Need PDF |
| PDA | TR81 (2020) — Cell-Based Potency Assays for Biologics | Medium | ⬜ Need PDF |
| PDA | TR47 — Preparation of Biological Indicators | Small | ⬜ Need PDF |
| EP | 5.1.6 — Alternative Methods for Microbiological Quality | Small | ⬜ Need PDF |

### Phase 7: Future — COO Decision Support Layer

**Goal:** Synthesize cross-document knowledge into decision-oriented resources. These are also candidates for Layer 2 operational frameworks.

| Task | Description |
|------|------------|
| FDA 483 analysis | Common sterile manufacturing observations — cross-referenced to hub documents |
| Deviation triage framework | Synthesized from ICH Q9, Q10, TR88, TR90 |
| Batch disposition decision trees | Risk-based release/reject/reprocess guidance |
| Inspection readiness checklists | Per-area checklists mapped to Annex 1, FDA guidance |
| Operational KPI benchmarks | Industry benchmarks for sterile manufacturing metrics |

---

## Low Priority / Market-Specific Sources

Add only when client mix justifies:

| Source | Scope | When to Add |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **PMDA + JP** | Japanese regulatory guidance + Japanese Pharmacopoeia | If Japan MAA clients increase |
| **NMPA + ChP** | China GMP + Chinese Pharmacopoeia | If China market entry planned |
| **EMA product-specific** | Biologics, lyophilization, ATMP guidelines | When ATMP or EU biologics clients onboard |
| **ICH Q5 series** | Q5A–E: viral safety, stability for biologics | If biologics API clients increase |
| **ICH Q11** | Drug substance development | When regulatory submission support expands |

> **ICH scope note:** Q8/Q9/Q10/Q12/Q13/Q14 are included in this hub (analytical + manufacturing lifecycle). The full ICH set (Q1–Q7, Q11, S-series, E-series, M-series) is not sterile-manufacturing-specific.

> **IEC scope note:** IEC 62366-1 is included only for combination product human factors validation. Other IEC standards are out of scope.

---

## Documents NOT in Scope

| Document | Why Excluded |
|----------|-------------|
| ICH Q1–Q7, Q11 | General pharma chemistry / drug substance — not sterile-manufacturing-specific |
| ICH S-series, E-series, M-series | Safety, efficacy, multidisciplinary — not manufacturing-focused |
| ASTM standards | ASTM E2500 (verification) is influential but too niche for this hub |
| ISO 11135 (EtO sterilization) | Rarely used for sterile injectables |
| ISO 11137 (Radiation sterilization) | Niche; for devices not primary pharma injectables |
| ISO 11608-4/5 (Electronic/automated injection systems) | Advanced device electronics — out of scope (ISO 11608-1/3 in Phase 5) |
| IEC standards other than 62366-1 | Electrical safety, EMC, cybersecurity — outside GMP scope |
| Full PDA TR catalog | Many TRs cover non-sterile topics. Only sterile-relevant TRs included |
| BP (British Pharmacopoeia) | ~95% harmonized with Ph. Eur. post-Brexit. Add Ph. Eur. first |
| ChP (Chinese Pharmacopoeia) | Add only if China in-market manufacturing is in scope |
| ANVISA / LatAm regulations | Region-specific; add only if Latin America supply is strategic |
